## 📢 About

**TL;DR:** MoCam is a method that enables stable video re-camera under extreme camera motion. MoCam introduces structured denoising dynamics that guide generation from motion alignment to appearance refinement, producing coherent and photorealistic results.

**Features:** MoCam generates high-quality video re-camera effects under large camera movements, supporting:
- Large-movement Trajectories
- Complex Trajectories
- Dolly Zoom
- Zoom In/Out
- Bullet Time
